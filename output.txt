++++++++++++++++++++ Effective Memory-Access Time ++++++++++++++++++
Assuming,
 20ns TLB search time and 1ns memory access time
memory accesses: 3; total memory accesses 6 (less page faults)
TLB hit rate = 0.500000
Effective memory-access time = 21.500000ns
++++++++++++++++++++ Effective Access Time ++++++++++++++++++
Assuming,
 4ms average page-fault service time (w/o swap out), a 2ms average swap out time, and 1ns memory access time
swaps: 3; invalidates: 3; page faults: 7
Page fault ratio = 0.538462
Effective access time = 2.625308ms
